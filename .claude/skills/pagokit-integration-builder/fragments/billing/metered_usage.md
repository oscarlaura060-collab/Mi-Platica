# Metered usage

Billing for what the customer actually consumed — tokens, requests, minutes, gigabytes — which is what AI applications need and what a plan-and-price subscription cannot express. **This is a layer over a PSP, not a replacement for one.** Metering decides the number on the invoice; a provider from `subscription_card.md` still has to collect it, with a stored credential, an MIT and a dunning loop underneath. A metering system with no PSP under it produces beautiful invoices nobody pays.

The thing developers get wrong is treating a usage event like a log line. A duplicated log line is noise; a duplicated usage event is **a double charge on a real invoice**, and a dropped one is revenue you will never find again because nothing downstream knows it existed. So idempotency lives on the *event*, minted by the emitter as a deterministic id, not on the HTTP request. Retries, at-least-once queues and a client that fires twice on a slow network are all normal, and all of them must land on the same row.

**Providers in this family:** none yet — no entry in the catalog carries a `metered` block, so every field named below reads as `undefined` today. The nearest thing is Lago, catalogued at `advise` with `role: "billing_layer"`: exactly the shape this fragment describes, a metering and invoicing layer that sits over a PSP rather than replacing one. When its `metered` block lands, expect `metered.requires_psp: true`. Until then the aggregation below runs in the merchant's own database and hands a total to the subscription flow.

**Catalog fields this fragment reads:** `metered.event_ingestion`, `metered.meters`, `metered.credit_balances`, `metered.requires_psp`, `supports.subscriptions`, `currencies[].exponent`, `webhook.signature_header`, `webhook.secret_env`, `webhook.event_id_pointer`.

## The contract

1. **The emitter mints the id.** `sha256(subject | meter | occurred_at | source_ref)`. Deterministic on purpose: two retries of the same call must collide. This is not the Rule 4 case — the cryptographic UUID belongs on the *invoice charge* you send the PSP; a usage event id must be reproducible, so it is a content hash.
2. **Ingest defensively.** Cap the body (Rule 10) and cap the batch. Verify the caller's HMAC in constant time. Insert with a unique index on `event_id` and treat the conflict as success.
3. **Bill by `occurred_at`, not arrival.** An event that happened at 23:59 on the last of the month belongs to that month even if it lands the next morning.
4. **Freeze, then adjust.** After a lateness grace the period closes. Anything arriving later posts to the next period, tagged with the period it adjusts. Reopening a closed period after you invoiced it is how the metered total and the invoiced total stop agreeing forever.
5. **Roll up by recomputation.** A rollup is `SUM` over deduplicated source events, never `balance = balance + n`. Recomputing must be safe to do twice.
6. **Credits are a ledger.** Append-only entries; the balance is their sum. Spend expiring-soonest first, then oldest. A mutable `credits_remaining` column drifts the first time two workers debit concurrently.
7. **Overage invoices.** What credits could not cover becomes an invoice line, converted to minor units with the currency's exponent, charged through the PSP.
8. **Reconcile every period.** Metered total versus invoiced total, per subject. Any drift is a bug in the pipeline, and the only way you find it is by checking.

**Express (Rule 5):** the ingestion route needs `express.raw({ type: 'application/json', limit: '256kb' })` registered **before** `app.use(express.json())`, exactly like a webhook — the HMAC covers the bytes the client sent, and a re-serialised body will not match. FastAPI uses `await request.body()`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Idempotency on the HTTP request instead of the event. The client retries the batch with a new request id and every event inside it counts twice.
- ❌ A random UUID as the usage event id. It defeats the whole mechanism: the retry gets a new id and a second charge.
- ❌ Assigning the period by arrival time. Every month-end boundary event lands in the wrong invoice.
- ❌ Reopening a frozen period after invoicing it. The metered total and the invoiced total never agree again, and you cannot tell which one is right.
- ❌ `credits_remaining -= n` as an UPDATE. Two concurrent debits lose one. Append to the ledger and derive.
- ❌ Spending non-expiring credits before expiring ones — the customer's expiring pack silently evaporates and support gets the ticket.
- ❌ Floats for units. A million float additions do not sum to what the customer counted. Reject them at ingest — a signed request is an authentic caller, not a correct one, and a negative `units` is a discount the customer wrote themselves.
- ❌ `catch { duplicates++ }` around the insert. A dead database then reads as "already recorded", the endpoint answers 200, and the client never retries. Only a unique violation is a duplicate; everything else is a 500.
- ❌ Capping on `content-length` alone. It is absent on chunked bodies and supplied by the caller — check the real byte length after reading, exactly as the webhook preamble does.
- ❌ Logging the usage payload. For an AI product that payload is the prompt (Rule 6).
- ❌ No reconciliation step. The gap between metered and invoiced only ever gets discovered by a customer.
- ❌ Building metering and calling it billing. Without the PSP layer there is no stored credential, no dunning and no way to collect.

## Security rules cited

- **Rule 3:** the ingestion endpoint verifies the caller's HMAC before parsing, reusing `safeEqual` / `safe_equal` from `_preamble.md` — length first, then `timingSafeEqual` / `hmac.compare_digest`. Failure is a bare 400.
- **Rule 4:** `crypto.randomUUID()` / `uuid.uuid4()` on the PSP invoice charge. The usage event id is deliberately *not* a UUID — it is a content hash, because it must collide on retry.
- **Rule 5:** `await request.text()` under `runtime = 'nodejs'`; `express.raw(...)` before `express.json()`; `await request.body()` on FastAPI. The ingest HMAC covers the received bytes.
- **Rule 6:** ingestion logs counts, reconciliation logs totals and ids. Neither logs an event body.
- **Rule 9:** the unique index on `event_id` is the replay defence — this endpoint has no signed timestamp, so dedup is the whole of it, exactly as for a `timestamp_source: none` webhook scheme.
- **Rule 10:** 256 KB enforced twice — on `content-length` before reading, on `Buffer.byteLength` after — plus a 1000-event batch cap, because a body under the cap can still hold a batch that blocks the event loop.
- **Rule 11:** a usage event carries a subject id and a meter. It is not the place for the customer's email, and never for the content being metered.
