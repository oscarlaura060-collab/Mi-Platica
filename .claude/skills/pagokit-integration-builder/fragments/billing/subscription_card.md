# Subscription — stored card

Recurring billing against a card kept on file. Almost every template stops at "create the subscription, grant access", which is the first five minutes of a relationship that lasts years. Everything that decides whether you keep the revenue happens later: the trial converting, the renewal that declines, the card that expires, the plan change nobody prorated, the cancel that should have been end-of-period. **Involuntary churn — cards that expired or declined — is usually larger than the churn people actually choose**, and it is the only kind you can engineer away.

The second thing developers get wrong is invisible until a renewal declines with a code they have never seen. The first charge is **customer-initiated** (CIT): the cardholder is present and can answer a 3DS challenge. Every renewal after it is **merchant-initiated** (MIT), and an MIT is only valid if it carries the **network transaction id returned by that original CIT**. Mastercard requires the stored Trace ID on economically-related MITs from **23 October 2026**; an unlinked MIT is a decline, not a warning. If your `subscriptions` table has no column for it, every renewal you have is on borrowed time.

**Providers in this family:** 28 catalog entries carry `supports.subscriptions: true`; the three at `integration_level: build` are Stripe (`recurring.rails: ["card","sepa_debit","ach_debit"]`, `network_txn_id_required: true` — the only entry where that flag is true), Mercado Pago (`rails: ["card"]`, `network_txn_id_required: false`) and Lemon Squeezy (`rails: ["card"]`, `mor.is_mor: true` — it owns the stored credential, so these columns are reconciliation data rather than something you send; Paddle and Polar are the catalog's other merchants of record and behave the same way). Wompi is **not** in this family: `supports.subscriptions: false` and `recurring.rails: []`, so recurring there means your own scheduler over saved cards — and then the CIT/MIT linkage below is yours to maintain, not the provider's. Every other subscription-capable entry is `advise` and carries no `recurring` block yet, so treat `network_txn_id_required` as unknown rather than false for those.

**Catalog fields this fragment reads:** `supports.subscriptions`, `supports.save_card`, `supports.tokenization_owner`, `recurring.rails`, `recurring.network_txn_id_required`, `recurring.mandate_lifecycle`, `mor.is_mor`, `webhook.required_events_minimum`, `methods[card].reversibility`, `currencies[].exponent`.

## The contract

1. **Trial.** Take the card up front with a zero-amount or account-verification CIT so 3DS happens while the customer is watching. Status `trialing`, `trial_ends_at` set. A trial without a stored credential is a signup, not a trial.
2. **Activation.** At `trial_ends_at`, run the first real charge. If it needs a challenge it is still a CIT; store what it returns.
3. **Store the credential.** From the CIT response persist the token, `network_transaction_id`, the scheme, and `cit_completed_at`. Never the PAN (Rule 12).
4. **Renew as an MIT.** Every subsequent charge carries the stored `network_transaction_id` and an explicit merchant-initiated flag.
5. **Upgrade** prorates immediately: charge the unused-to-new difference now. **Downgrade** schedules at period end and issues account credit — never a refund by default.
6. **Dunning.** On decline, classify: hard declines (stolen, lost, invalid account, revoked authorisation) stop instantly and mark the credential dead. Soft declines enter the retry schedule.
7. **Grace.** `past_due` keeps entitlements until `grace_until`. Access is a function of state and clock, never a boolean column someone forgot to flip.
8. **Involuntary churn.** Watch `card_exp_month/year`; warn at T-30 days and again at T-7. This is cheaper than every recovery email you will send afterwards.
9. **Cancel.** Immediate (`access_until = now`) or end-of-period (`cancel_at_period_end = true`, `access_until = current_period_end`). Default to end-of-period.
10. **Reactivate.** Before the period ends: clear the flag, no new CIT. After it ends: a new subscription and a **new CIT** — the old network transaction id belongs to a finished agreement and reusing it produces an unlinked MIT.

States — `incomplete → trialing → active → past_due → canceled`, plus `paused`. `cancel_at_period_end` is a flag on `active`, not a state; modelling it as one loses the fact that the customer is still entitled.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ No `network_transaction_id` column — every renewal is an unlinked MIT and starts declining on 23 Oct 2026 with a code your error map has never seen.
- ❌ Reusing the old trace id after the customer replaces the card, or after a cancel-and-resubscribe. A new PAN or a new agreement means a new CIT and a new id.
- ❌ Granting access on `checkout.session.completed` alone. That event fires once; the subscription then lives in `customer.subscription.updated` forever.
- ❌ A `has_access` boolean column. It drifts within a week. Compute entitlement from state plus clock.
- ❌ Loading the subscription by the `subscriptionId` in the request body without scoping it to the caller. Plan changes, pauses and cancels are all one guessable id away from being done to somebody else's account.
- ❌ Reading `decline_code` off the invoice instead of the failed payment. `undefined` is not in `HARD_DECLINES`, so every hard decline silently becomes a soft one and gets re-presented on a schedule.
- ❌ Retrying a hard decline. It generates scheme fees, and past the excessive-retry threshold, fines.
- ❌ Retrying forever on soft declines. The schedule must terminate in a cancellation.
- ❌ Refunding on downgrade by default — issue account credit; refunds on a card invite a dispute you will lose.
- ❌ Cancelling immediately when the customer clicks cancel mid-period. They paid for the period; end-of-period is both fairer and the law in several markets.
- ❌ Modelling `cancel_at_period_end` as a state. The customer is still entitled and still countable as active.
- ❌ No customer portal. Cancellation must be self-service; in the EU and California, making it harder than signup is a regulatory problem, not a growth tactic.

## Security rules cited

- **Rule 3:** the subscription branch runs only after `verifySignature` (fragments/webhook/<family>.md); an invalid signature is a bare 400.
- **Rule 4:** `crypto.randomUUID()` / `uuid.uuid4()` on every subscription mutation and every renewal charge — a retried renewal must not become two charges.
- **Rule 5:** `await request.text()` under `runtime = 'nodejs'`; `express.raw(...)` before `express.json()`; `await request.body()` on FastAPI.
- **Rule 6:** dunning and expiry jobs carry ids, `last4` and brand — never the invoice payload, which holds the billing address.
- **Rule 9:** renewals are retried by the provider on any 5xx, so the event-id dedup table is what stops a retried `invoice.payment_failed` from advancing the dunning counter twice.
- **Rule 10:** 256 KB cap on the webhook route; subscription payloads with long line-item lists are the biggest bodies you will receive.
- **Rule 12:** `PagokitStoredCredential` holds a provider token, brand, last4 and expiry. No PAN, no CVV — storing either puts the merchant in PCI Level 1 scope.
