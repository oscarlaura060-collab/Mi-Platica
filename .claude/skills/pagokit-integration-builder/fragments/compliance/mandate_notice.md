# Direct-debit mandate pre-notification

On a direct-debit rail the payer is not present at the moment of the debit — you are reaching into their account on the strength of a mandate they signed once. Every scheme compensates for that by requiring **advance notice before each collection**, and it is a condition of the debit rather than a courtesy: miss it and the payer's indemnity claim succeeds automatically, which on Bacs means up to 395 days later, and on SEPA means 8 weeks no-questions-asked. The thing developers get wrong is the direction of the dependency. They pick a collection date, create the charge, and send "your payment is being processed" — at which point the notice window has already closed and the debit is unlawful the moment it settles. **The notice does not follow the collection date; the collection date follows the notice.** Every scheduling function below is written that way: you ask for the earliest date you may legally collect, and the answer is a function of today plus the rail's lead time.

**Providers in this family:** of the catalog's 42 providers, exactly one qualifies today — Stripe, with `recurring.mandate_lifecycle: true` and `recurring.rails: ["card", "sepa_debit", "ach_debit"]`. Every other provider either sets `mandate_lifecycle: false` or carries no `recurring` block at all, so the recipe skips this fragment for them. That gate is narrower than method coverage, deliberately: `methods.json` carries eight rails at `category: "direct_debit"` — `ach_debit`, `bacs_debit`, `becs_debit`, `pac_chile`, `payto`, `pix_automatico`, `sepa_debit`, `upi_autopay` — and each of the eight is offered by at least one provider (GoCardless three of them, Airwallex `becs_debit` and `payto`, Razorpay `upi_autopay`, Fintoc `pac_chile`, Asaas `pix_automatico`). All of those entries are `integration_level: advise`, and none declares a mandate lifecycle. **Listing a direct-debit rail is not the same as having the mandate lifecycle to schedule notices on it**, and the gate is the second one. This fragment ships ahead of those waves, which is why the rail table below is keyed by rail and not by provider.

> **Composer note.** Nothing selects this fragment yet. `recipes/default.json` references `compliance/pci_script_inventory.md` and `compliance/einvoice.md`, but no slot lists `compliance/mandate_notice.md`, so the composer will never emit it and the gate in step 1 below is currently unreachable. It belongs on the `billing/subscription_mandate` slot, or on a new slot with `skip_if: "provider.recurring?.mandate_lifecycle != true OR no rail in provider.recurring.rails has methods[rail].category == 'direct_debit'"`. Fix that in the recipe, not here.

**Catalog fields this fragment reads:** `recurring.mandate_lifecycle`, `recurring.rails`, `recurring.network_txn_id_required`, `methods[rail].category`, `methods[rail].reversibility`, `methods[rail].reversal_window_days`, `methods[rail].notes`, `regions[CODE].languages`.

## The contract

1. Gate on the catalog: emit nothing unless `recurring.mandate_lifecycle` is true and some rail in `recurring.rails` has `methods[rail].category == "direct_debit"`. A card-on-file subscription has no pre-notification duty; conflating the two produces notices nobody needs and trains users to ignore them.
2. Derive the collection date **from** the notice deadline, never the reverse. `earliestCollectionDate(rail, now)` is the only legal starting point for a first debit.
3. Count in the rail's own unit. SEPA and PAD count calendar days; Bacs counts **working** days, so weekends and bank holidays push the date out. Counting Bacs in calendar days is silently four days late in a normal month.
4. Put every field the scheme mandates in the notice — amount, collection date, mandate reference, creditor/service-user identity — in the payer's language (`regions[CODE].languages[0]`). A notice that omits the amount is not a notice.
5. Re-arm on change. A different amount or a different date is a **new** notice with a fresh full lead time, on SEPA, Bacs and PAD alike. The dedup key must therefore include the amount, or a price rise ships silently.
6. Emit exactly once per (mandate, collection date, amount). Insert the row, then enqueue; never send the email inside the scheduling transaction (Rule 4's idempotency argument, applied to outbound mail).
7. Persist what you sent. When the indemnity claim arrives — 56 days on SEPA, 395 on Bacs — the notice record is the only evidence you have.
8. Record the reversal exposure. `methods[rail].reversibility` is `mandate_indemnity` on every rail in the table below that the catalog carries — `sepa_debit`, `bacs_debit`, `ach_debit`, and also `pac_chile`, `payto`, `pix_automatico`, `upi_autopay`. The one exception is `becs_debit`, which is `refund_only`; read the field rather than assuming, because the remedy differs. Either way a "successful" charge is not final, and downstream code must not treat settlement as revenue.

## The rails

| Rail | Notice lead | Unit | The notice must state | `reversal_window_days` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sepa_debit` | 14 (default; the mandate may agree otherwise) | calendar | Amount, due date, Unique Mandate Reference, Creditor Identifier | 56 — plus 13 months if unauthorised |
| `bacs_debit` | 10 (a shorter period only if agreed with your sponsoring bank/PSP) | **working** | Amount, collection date, Service User name, the Direct Debit Guarantee | 395 |
| `pad_ca` (Canada, Rule H1) | 10 for a variable amount, unless waived in the PAD agreement | calendar | Amount, due date, recourse rights, how to cancel | not in the catalog |
| `upi_autopay` | 24 **hours** | hours | Amount, debit date, UMN; AFA required above the per-transaction limit | not stated |
| `ach_debit` (Nacha) | 10 on an amount change, 7 on a date change | calendar | New amount or new effective date | 60 |

`upi_autopay`'s AFA threshold has moved more than once and differs by mandate category — read it from configuration and never hardcode it. `pad_ca` is not in `methods.json`; when it is added, this table row is what its entry should encode.

`becs_debit` (AU) **is** in the catalog as a direct-debit rail but has no row in `NOTICE`, so `leadFor` throws `no pre-notification rule for rail "becs_debit" — do not debit`. That is the correct failure, not a gap to paper over: BECS carries its own advance-notice duty under the payer's Direct Debit Request Service Agreement, and inventing a lead time produces a notice that is confidently wrong. Add the row from the scheme rules, or use PayTo — which `methods.json` already recommends for new AU integrations.

Verified against the UK 2026 bank-holiday set. A collection on `2026-09-30` puts the Bacs notice deadline at `2026-09-16`; counting those same 10 days on the calendar gives `2026-09-20` — four days late, every time, silently. SEPA's 14 calendar days happen to land on `2026-09-16` too in that month, which is a coincidence and not a reason to share the code path. Asked on Monday 31 August 2026 (a UK bank holiday) for the earliest Bacs collection, `scheduleCollection` returns `2026-09-14` with `sendNow: true`; a mandate that records a 5-day SEPA lead moves the SEPA floor to `2026-09-05`, while a mandate claiming a 2-day Bacs lead is ignored and the floor stays at `2026-09-14`.

The scheduling functions above transliterate directly: `timedelta` for `shiftDays`, `date` comparison for `wanted < earliest`, and `hmac.compare_digest` — guarded by the same explicit length check — in place of `timingSafeEqual`.

```text
SEPA Direct Debit — pre-notification              (send by noticeDueAt, ≥14 calendar days ahead)
Subject: We will collect {amount} {currency} on {collection_date}

We will debit {amount} {currency} from the account ending {last4} on or shortly after
{collection_date}, under the mandate you signed on {mandate_signed_at}.

Mandate reference (UMR): {umr}
Creditor Identifier (CID): {creditor_id}
Creditor: {creditor_name}

If the amount or the date changes we will tell you again, with the same notice period. You
can dispute a collected direct debit with your bank for 8 weeks without giving a reason.
```

```text
Bacs Direct Debit — advance notice           (send by noticeDueAt, ≥10 WORKING days ahead)
Subject: {service_user_name} will collect {amount} on {collection_date}

Amount: {amount}   Collection date: {collection_date}
Service User Number: {sun}   Reference: {dd_reference}

The Direct Debit Guarantee
- This Guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to
  pay Direct Debits.
- If there are any changes to the amount, date or frequency of your Direct Debit
  {service_user_name} will notify you {lead} working days in advance of your account being
  debited, or as otherwise agreed. If you request {service_user_name} to collect a payment,
  confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request.
- If an error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit by {service_user_name} or your bank
  or building society, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund of the amount paid
  from your bank or building society.
- If you receive a refund you are not entitled to, you must pay it back when
  {service_user_name} asks you to.
- You can cancel a Direct Debit at any time by simply contacting your bank or building
  society. Written confirmation may be required. Please also notify us.
```

The Guarantee is published scheme wording. Reproduce it, do not paraphrase it, and confirm the current text and your agreed notice period with your sponsoring bank or PSP before go-live. Everything from *The Direct Debit Guarantee* heading down **is** the value of `ddg_text` — it is inlined here so you can read it, and it is a `MANDATORY["bacs_debit"]` field so that an edit to the template body cannot quietly drop it. If you shorten the template to `{ddg_text}`, the required field is what fills it back in; if you keep it inline, pass the same block as `ddg_text` so the check still bites.

```text
UPI AutoPay — pre-debit notification                    (send by noticeDueAt, ≥24 hours ahead)
Subject: {amount} will be debited on {collection_date}

Mandate (UMN): {umn}   Merchant: {merchant_name}
{afa_line}
Pause or cancel this mandate in your UPI app, or here: {manage_url}
```

`{afa_line}` is emitted by `render_notice` only when `amount_minor > afa_threshold_minor`, and reads: *"You will be asked to authenticate this debit, because it is above the per-transaction e-mandate limit."* Below the threshold the debit runs unattended and the line would be a lie.

```text
Pre-Authorized Debit (Canada) — notice                  (send by noticeDueAt, ≥10 days ahead)
Subject: PAD of {amount} on {collection_date}

Payee: {payee_name}, {payee_contact}
Amount: {amount}   Due date: {collection_date}   Agreement: {pad_agreement_id}
This is a {pad_category} PAD under a {pad_frequency} agreement.

You have certain recourse rights if a debit does not comply with this agreement — for
example, the right to a reimbursement of any debit not authorised or not consistent with
the PAD agreement. Recourse must be claimed within {recourse_window}.
You may cancel this agreement at any time with 30 days' written notice: {manage_url}
```

`pad_category` is `personal` or `business`; `pad_frequency` is `fixed`, `variable` or
`sporadic`; `recourse_window` is `90 calendar days` for a personal PAD and `10 business days`
for a business one. They are real fields on `MANDATORY["pad_ca"]`, not choose-one prose: a
pipe left in the template is an unsubstituted placeholder, and `render_notice` refuses to send
it rather than mailing the payer a literal `{personal|business}`.

The PAD agreement itself — payor name, account, amount and frequency, recourse statement, cancellation terms, payee contact — is a separate document collected before the first debit; the notice above does not replace it. Confirm both against Payments Canada Rule H1.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Sending the notice when the charge is created. The window is measured backwards from the collection date, so by then it is already gone. Derive the date from `earliestCollectionDate`.
- ❌ Counting Bacs lead time in calendar days. Ten calendar days is roughly six working days: every notice ships late, and the Direct Debit Guarantee makes each of those debits refundable on request.
- ❌ An empty or stale bank-holiday set. `shiftDays` is only as correct as `holidays`; a missing August bank holiday moves the deadline by one day and nobody notices until an indemnity claim.
- ❌ Raising the price and reusing the existing notice. A changed amount re-arms the full lead time on SEPA, Bacs and PAD — which is why `notice_key` includes `amount_minor`.
- ❌ Sending the email inside the scheduling transaction. An SMTP timeout rolls back the notice record, the next run re-sends, and the payer gets duplicates for a debit that never moved.
- ❌ Treating a settled direct debit as final revenue. Every rail in the table that the catalog carries is `reversibility: "mandate_indemnity"` — 56 days on SEPA, **395** on Bacs, 60 on ACH. (`becs_debit` is `refund_only`; a different remedy, not a shorter one.)
- ❌ Logging the IBAN, sort code or account number with the notice (Rule 6). Log `mandate_id`, rail and collection date; the payer's bank details belong in the mandate record, not in your log pipeline.
- ❌ Shortening a lead because "the customer agreed in the UI". A checkbox is not a mandate: `leadFor` accepts a shorter period only on the rails whose scheme lets the mandate agree one (SEPA, PAD), and only from a value recorded on the mandate itself. It never shortens Bacs, UPI AutoPay or ACH.

## Security rules cited

- **Rule 4** — `notice_key` = `mandate_id:collection_date:amount_minor` is the idempotency key for outbound notices: a scheduler re-run is a no-op, a price change is a new notice. Same argument as the `idempotency_keys` table, applied to mail.
- **Rule 6** — the notice path logs `mandate_id`, rail and collection date only. Never the IBAN, sort code, account number or payer name.
- **Rule 9** — the unique constraint on `notice_key` is the same dedup pattern as `webhook_events_processed`: exactly-once behaviour from a database constraint rather than from application memory.
- **Rule 11** — the notice carries only what its scheme mandates. `last4` is enough to identify the account for the payer; the full IBAN in an email is a data breach waiting for a forwarded message.
- **Rule 12** — a mandate reference (UMR, UMN, SUN, PAD agreement id) is not card data and is safe to store and display. The PAN wall is untouched by anything here.
- Constant-time comparison guards `verifyNoticeToken` / `verify_notice_token`, so the manage-mandate link in a notice cannot be brute-forced byte by byte.
