# `hmac_body_transform` — HMAC over a transform of the body, not the bytes

The MAC input is derived from the body rather than being the body: base64 of it, a JSON re-serialisation of it, or the body with something prepended. The trap is that `webhook.signed_payload_template` still reads `{raw_body}`, so a generator that expands the template literally produces a `hmac_raw_body` verifier — which rejects every genuine event while looking completely reasonable. **In this family the `verification_family` value is itself a parameter:** it tells you that `{raw_body}` does not mean "the bytes as received", and the specific transform comes from the provider's `webhook.algorithm` prose and `overrides/<provider>/notes.md`. Never infer it from the template alone.

**Providers in this family:** no entry carries `verification_family: "hmac_body_transform"` yet — this fragment ships ahead of the wave that promotes them. Two catalog entries describe the shape in their `webhook.algorithm` prose:

| Provider | Signed string | Shape | Where it is written down |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bold | `base64(body)` | encoding transform | `providers/bold.json` — "the signed message is the BASE64 encoding of the request body, not the raw body" |
| Square | `notification_url + body` | prefix, bytes untouched | `providers/square.json` — "computed over `<notification URL> + <raw body>`" |
| — | `compact_json(body)` | re-serialisation | **no provider.** Defensive only: see below |

The Square shape is expressible as a template (`{notification_url}{raw_body}`, which `scripts/lib/webhook-sign.js` already resolves); Bold's transform has to be applied in code. The third row has no member in the catalog and you must not give it one on a hunch — a provider that signs a re-serialisation says so in its own documentation, and until an entry says so with `evidence.confidence: high`, `BODY_TRANSFORM = 'reserialize'` is a fallback you enable knowingly, never a default. (Kushki looks like it belongs here and does not: `X-Kushki-Signature` signs `{raw_body}.<X-Kushki-Id>` over the untouched bytes with a unix-seconds suffix, which is `hmac_timestamp_body` — and it means a tolerance window is available there, which this family mostly cannot offer.)

**Catalog fields this fragment reads:** `webhook.verification_family`, `webhook.signed_payload_template`, `webhook.signature_header`, `webhook.header_format`, `webhook.hash_algo`, `webhook.secret_encoding`, `webhook.digest_encoding`, `webhook.timestamp_source`, `webhook.replay_mitigation_strategy`, `webhook.event_id_pointer`, `webhook.secret_env`.

## The contract

1. Read and unpack the signature header exactly as `hmac_raw_body` does.
2. Identify the transform from the provider entry — encoding (`base64`), re-serialisation (`JSON.stringify`), or prefix/suffix. It is a documented per-provider fact, never a guess.
3. Apply the transform to the **raw bytes**, then expand the template around the result. The prefix cases (`{notification_url}{raw_body}`) leave the bytes untouched; only the surrounding string changes.
4. For a re-serialisation scheme, build **two candidates** — one from the raw bytes, one from `JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(rawBody))` — and accept either. See below for why.
5. HMAC, encode, compare constant-time against every candidate. (Rule 3)
6. `timestamp_source` is typically `none` in this family, so event-id dedup from `_preamble.md` is the sole replay defence, exactly as in `hmac_raw_body`. (Rule 9)

## Why re-serialisation is fragile

`JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(text))` is **not** an identity function, and every difference changes the MAC. Measured, not assumed:

| Received bytes | After a parse/stringify round trip |
|---|---|
| `{"b":1,"2":2,"a":3,"1":4}` | `{"1":4,"2":2,"b":1,"a":3}` — integer-like keys jump to the front, ascending |
| `{"a":1.0,"b":1e2,"c":1.50}` | `{"a":1,"b":100,"c":1.5}` — numbers renormalise |
| `{"id":12345678901234567890}` | `{"id":12345678901234567000}` — precision gone past 2^53 |
| `{"n":"caf\u00e9"}` | `{"n":"café"}` — escapes decode; 17 bytes become 13 |
| `{"u":"a\/b"}` | `{"u":"a/b"}` — the escaped solidus is dropped |
| `{"a":1,"a":2}` | `{"a":2}` — duplicate keys collapse |
| pretty-printed JSON | whitespace and indentation gone |

Any one of these makes an authentic event fail verification, intermittently, for whichever merchant happens to have an accented name or a long numeric id. Python is worse: `json.dumps` defaults to `", "` / `": "` separators and `ensure_ascii=True`, so `{"n":"café","a":1}` comes back as `{"n": "café", "a": 1}` — three differences at once. It needs `json.dumps(obj, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False)` even to be in the running.

**How to handle it safely:** never re-serialise when the raw bytes will do, and when the scheme genuinely signs a re-serialisation, verify against both candidates. Accepting either costs one extra HMAC and weakens nothing — both candidates are MACs under the same secret, so an attacker gains no forgery they did not already have. Log which candidate matched, and you will learn within a day whether your provider's bytes actually survive the round trip.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Expanding `signed_payload_template` literally because it says `{raw_body}`. That is the whole reason this family has its own name — you get a `hmac_raw_body` verifier that rejects 100% of genuine events. (Rule 3)
- ❌ `JSON.stringify(await request.json())` as the *only* candidate. It is the fragile path; make the raw bytes candidate 0 so the common case never depends on a round trip. (Rule 5)
- ❌ `json.dumps(body)` in Python without `separators=(",", ":")` and `ensure_ascii=False`. The defaults differ from JavaScript in three ways at once.
- ❌ Deriving Square's `notification_url` from `request.url`. Behind a load balancer, an ngrok tunnel or a rewrite, that string is not what the dashboard was configured with, and the prefix must match byte for byte — trailing slash included.
- ❌ Base64-encoding the *decoded string* rather than the bytes when the body is non-ASCII. `Buffer.from(rawBody, 'utf8')` and `base64.b64encode(raw_body)` both take the wire bytes; re-encoding through another charset changes the digest.
- ❌ Treating this family as timestamped. `timestamp_source` is normally `none`, so a captured event replays forever without the preamble's dedup row. (Rule 9)
- ❌ `raw_body.decode("utf-8")` unguarded, in Python. A body that is not valid UTF-8 raises inside the verifier, and the framework answers `500` with a traceback where the answer was a silent `400`.
- ❌ Guessing the transform. If the provider's scheme is not documented in the catalog with `evidence.confidence: high`, emit the re-fetch path and a TODO instead of a verifier that looks authoritative and is wrong. Filing a provider here because its signed string merely *looks* derived is the same mistake — Kushki's `{raw_body}.<timestamp>` is a suffix over untouched bytes, so it is `hmac_timestamp_body` and gets a replay window this family would have thrown away.

## Security rules cited

- **Rule 3:** MAC verified before the payload is used; constant-time comparison across every candidate and every presented signature, with no early exit.
- **Rule 5:** the transform is computed *from* the raw bytes captured by the stack's raw-body API; the untransformed candidate is tried first so the correct path never depends on a JSON round trip.
- **Rule 6:** logging stays in the preamble — `id`, `type`, `created` only.
- **Rule 9:** with `timestamp_source: none` there is no window, so the preamble's event-id dedup is the only replay defence and is mandatory.
- **Rule 10:** the 256 KB cap runs in the preamble — relevant here because base64 expands the hashed input by a third.
