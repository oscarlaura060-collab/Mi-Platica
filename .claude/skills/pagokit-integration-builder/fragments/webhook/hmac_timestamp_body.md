# `hmac_timestamp_body` — HMAC over `{timestamp}{separator}{raw_body}`

The provider puts a timestamp *inside the signed string* and ships it beside the signature in a key-value header (`t=1780000000,v1=<hex>`). That one design choice is what turns a signature into a **credential that expires**, and the whole family exists to exploit it. The mistake is mechanical and extremely common: developers read `t` out of the header, hash `t + "." + body`, get a match, and never check that `t` is recent — or check it *after* computing the MAC. Both leave you exactly where `hmac_raw_body` sits, with a signature that verifies forever. The timestamp is only a replay defence because you reject on it; being signed just stops the attacker editing it.

**Providers in this family:** Stripe — the only entry carrying `verification_family: "hmac_timestamp_body"` today. Four more entries document the same shape in `webhook.algorithm` while still reading `verification_family: "unverified"`, and every one of them differs from Stripe in a detail that a Stripe-shaped verifier gets wrong: **Fintoc** (`t=…,v1=…`, `{timestamp}.{raw_body}` — the closest), **Paddle** (`Paddle-Signature: ts=…;h1=…` — `;` separator, `h1` key, and a **`:`** in the signed string, not a `.`), **Airwallex** (the timestamp arrives in its own `x-timestamp` header, so `timestamp_source: "header"`, and Airwallex prescribes no tolerance — the number is your decision to document), **Revolut Merchant** (`v1.<timestamp>.<raw_body>`, and its `Revolut-Request-Timestamp` is in **milliseconds** — comparing it to `Date.now()/1000` puts every event ~53,000 years in the future). Kushki fits here too, not in `hmac_body_transform`: `X-Kushki-Signature` signs `{raw_body}.<X-Kushki-Id>` with the id being unix seconds. Read the separator, keys, unit and tolerance from the entry rather than assuming Stripe's.

**Catalog fields this fragment reads:** `webhook.signature_header`, `webhook.header_format` (`kind: kv`, `separator`, `assign`, `timestamp_key`, `signature_key`), `webhook.signed_payload_template`, `webhook.hash_algo`, `webhook.secret_encoding`, `webhook.digest_encoding`, `webhook.recommended_tolerance_seconds`, `webhook.timestamp_source`, `webhook.replay_mitigation_strategy`, `webhook.secret_env`.

## The contract

1. Read `webhook.signature_header`. Absent → `400`.
2. Split it per `webhook.header_format`: on `separator` (`,`), then at the first `assign` (`=`). Split at the **first** `=` only — a base64 digest ends in `=` padding, and `part.split('=')` destroys it.
3. Pull the timestamp from `timestamp_key` (Stripe `t`, others `ts`) and **collect every** value under `signature_key` (`v1`). A provider mid-secret-rotation sends two `v1=` entries, one per active secret; keeping only the last one makes every rotation an outage. When `timestamp_source` is `header`, the timestamp is not in the signature header at all — read `webhook.timestamp_pointer` as a header name instead; nothing else in this fragment changes.
4. **Check the window before computing the MAC.** `|now − t| > webhook.recommended_tolerance_seconds` → `400`. Cheap rejection first, and it means a stale-but-cryptographically-valid event never reaches the hash.
5. Reject a non-numeric or absent `t` in the same branch: `Number('abc')` is `NaN`, and every comparison against `NaN` is false, so a naive `skew > TOL` test *accepts* it.
6. Build the signed string from `webhook.signed_payload_template` (`{timestamp}.{raw_body}`). The separator lives in the template — it is not always `.`.
7. HMAC, encode per `digest_encoding`, compare constant-time against each candidate. (Rule 3)
8. Keep the preamble's event-id dedup even though `replay_mitigation_strategy` is `timestamp-window`: a 300-second window is 300 seconds of free replays, and Stripe's own retries make duplicates a routine event, not an attack.

  const skew = Math.abs(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - Number(timestamp));
  if (!Number.isFinite(skew) || skew > TOLERANCE_S) return false;

  // Rule 5: the exact bytes go in unmodified. The replacer is a FUNCTION on purpose —

  // and the MAC silently changes. JSON payloads do contain those sequences.
  const signedString = TEMPLATE
    .replace('{timestamp}', () => String(timestamp))

  // Rule 3: constant-time against every candidate, no early exit (secret rotation).
  let matched = false;

## Why the signed timestamp is what makes the window meaningful

A window over an *unsigned* timestamp is decoration. If `t` travelled in its own unsigned header, an attacker replaying a captured event would simply rewrite `t` to `now` and the MAC — computed over the body alone — would still match. Because `t` is inside the hashed string, changing it invalidates the signature, and the attacker's only options are to replay the original `t` (rejected by the window) or forge a new MAC (needs the secret). That is the entire security argument, and it collapses the moment you skip step 4.

Two practical consequences:

- **Clock skew is now a security parameter.** `Math.abs()` bounds the window in both directions, so a server running 6 minutes fast rejects every genuine event with a 300s tolerance. Run NTP; do not "fix" the outage by widening the tolerance to an hour, which is what the incident channel will suggest.
- **The window bounds the damage, it does not eliminate it.** Within the tolerance the same event is replayable freely, which is why `_preamble.md`'s dedup transaction stays on even when `replay_mitigation_strategy` is `timestamp-window` alone.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Verifying the MAC first and checking `t` afterwards — or not at all. A signature that never expires is `hmac_raw_body` with extra steps. (Rule 9)
- ❌ `header.split(',').map(p => p.split('='))` — splits base64 padding apart and drops the second `v1` during a secret rotation.
- ❌ `TEMPLATE.replace('{raw_body}', rawBody)` with a **string** replacement, in JavaScript. `$&`, `` $` ``, `$'` and `$$` in the body are expanded by `String.replace`, so a payload carrying any of them silently changes the hashed input and the event is rejected. Use `() => rawBody`. (Verified against a signed event whose body contains all four sequences: it passes with the function replacer and the naive string form produces a different signed string.) Python's `str.replace` is literal, so this trap is JavaScript-only — which is exactly why it survives code review by a Python-shaped reader.
- ❌ Reconstructing the signed string as `` `${t}.${JSON.stringify(body)}` ``. Re-serialisation is not the received bytes. (Rule 5)
- ❌ `if (skew > TOLERANCE_S) return false` without `Number.isFinite` — `t=abc` yields `NaN`, the comparison is false, and the check passes the event through.
- ❌ `raw_body.decode("utf-8")` on the way into the hash, in Python. A body that is not valid UTF-8 raises inside the verifier, and an exception there is a `500` with a traceback where the answer was a silent `400`. Substitute into bytes instead.
- ❌ Hardcoding `300` or `.` — Wompi's tolerance is 600s, Paddle's separator is `:`, and Revolut's timestamp is in milliseconds. Take all three from the entry.
- ❌ Dropping event-id dedup because there is a window. 300 seconds is plenty for a replay, and provider retries produce duplicates with no attacker at all. (Rule 9)

## Security rules cited

- **Rule 3:** MAC verified before the payload is used; constant-time comparison over every candidate signature; a detail-free `400` on failure.
- **Rule 5:** `{raw_body}` is substituted with the untouched bytes from the stack's raw-body API, via a function replacer so the substitution itself cannot alter them.
- **Rule 9:** the tolerance window is enforced *before* the MAC and rejects non-numeric timestamps, layered on top of the preamble's event-id dedup.
- **Rule 10:** the 256 KB cap runs in the preamble, before these bytes reach the hash.
